## Overview

This project investigates how **particle friction** and **grain shape** control the steady-state structure of dense granular flows under shear. Using DEM simulations in a **linear split-bottom shear cell**, I quantified the competition between **alignment-driven compaction** and **friction-driven dilatancy**, and linked these microscopic mechanisms to macroscopic surface morphology.

This work is published in *Physical Review Fluids* (2026), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1103/z1rz-b4j6).

## Key contributions

- Performed DEM simulation of **spheres and elongated particles** (aspect ratio AR = 1–5) under controlled shear.
- Quantified steady-state macroscopic fields using coarse graining (packing density, velocity, stress).
- Measured particle alignment inside the shear band using orientation statistics and the nematic order parameter **S**.
- Connected friction-dependent alignment and stress localization to the observed **surface depressions** above the shear band.

## Methods & tools

- **Simulation:** MercuryDPM (multisphere particles, Hertz–Mindlin contact model).
- **Geometry:** linear split-bottom shear cell with periodic boundary conditions in the flow direction.
- **Particles:** spheres (AR = 1) and stick-shaped grains built from connected spheres (AR = 2–5).
- **Parameter range:** friction coefficient µ = 0.01–0.8; aspect ratio AR = 1–5.
- **Post-processing:** coarse-graining via `MercuryCG`, analysis and plotting in Python / MATLABS.

## Results (selected)

### Surface morphology depends strongly on shape

- For **spherical particles**, the surface profile above the shear band remains flat for all studied friction values.
- For **elongated particles**, shear induces a surface depression above the shear band due to alignment-driven compaction.

### Friction reduces alignment inside the shear band

- The nematic order parameter decreases with friction:
  - **S ≈ 0.8** at µ = 0.01  
  - **S ≈ 0.4** at µ = 0.8 :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- The mean orientation angle increases from approximately **0.12π → 0.23π**, indicating weaker alignment at higher friction. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

### Alignment-driven compaction vs friction-driven dilatancy

The simulations show two competing effects inside the shear band:

- **Alignment** increases packing density and drives compaction.
- **Dilatancy** decreases packing density and becomes more pronounced at higher friction.

This explains why the depression becomes **localized** at high friction and **broad** at low friction due to changes in shear-band width and stress localization.
