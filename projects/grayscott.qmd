## Overview

This project studies **pattern formation (Turing pattern)** in a **three-component Gray–Scott reaction–diffusion system**. I derived analytical conditions for diffusion-driven instability around the homogeneous steady state and used weakly nonlinear analysis to obtain amplitude equations that predict which patterns are stable near the Turing bifurcation.

This work was published in *Journal of Physics: Conference Series* (2019), [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1324/1/012012).

## Key contributions

- Derived analytical conditions for **Turing instability** using linear stability analysis and the Routh–Hurwitz criteria. 
- Obtained the **dispersion relation** and identified how diffusion coefficients control the transition from stable to unstable modes. 
- Derived the **amplitude equations** near the Turing bifurcation using multiple-scale weakly nonlinear analysis.
- Used amplitude-equation stability analysis to classify parameter regimes producing:
  - stripe (labyrinth) patterns
  - hexagonal (spot) patterns
  - mixed states :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Results (selected)

### Analytical Turing instability conditions

I derived closed-form conditions for when a temporally stable homogeneous steady state becomes unstable due to diffusion, producing stationary spatial patterns.

### Diffusion controls the unstable wavelength band

Dispersion relation analysis shows that decreasing the inhibitor diffusion coefficient can move the system across the Turing boundary and generate a band of unstable wave numbers.

### Amplitude equations predict pattern selection

Near the Turing bifurcation, the amplitude equations provide stability conditions for different planforms and predict transitions between stripe and hexagonal patterns.
