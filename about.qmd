## Hi, I'm Huzaif

I am a PhD Researcher in Germany working on **dense granular flow under shear** using **Discrete Element Method (DEM)** simulations in **MercuryDPM**. My research focuses on how **particle shape and friction** influence granular rheology, microstructure, stress anisotropy, and free-surface morphology.

I combine large-scale simulations with **micro–macro analysis**, extracting continuum fields (velocity, strain-rate, stress) using coarse-graining and reproducible Python-based post-processing.

---

## What I work on

- DEM simulations of sheared granular media (spheres and elongated grains)
- Particle alignment, stress anisotropy, secondary flow, and shear-band structure
- Free-surface morphology (surface depressions, heap formation)
- Automated simulation workflows and large dataset analysis in Python
- Pattern formation in reaction–diffusion PDEs (Turing / Gray–Scott systems)

---

## Tools I use

- **MercuryDPM**, Linux, HPC clusters
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Git, Bash, Jupyter, Quarto, LaTeX

## What I’m looking for

I am interested in roles in **computational physics / simulation**, **granular materials**, or **scientific computing**, where I can work on modelling, high-performance simulations, and data-driven analysis.
