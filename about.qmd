## Hi, I'm Huzaif

I am a PhD Researcher (with thesis submitted) at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), Germany, specializing in **computational modeling of dense granular flow** using the **Discrete Element Method (DEM)**. 

My work combines large-scale DEM simulations with rigorous micro–macro analysis to understand how **particle geometry and contact properties govern macroscopic material behavior**.

My research addresses fundamental questions in granular rheology:  
How do microscopic interactions give rise to stress anisotropy, shear localization, secondary flow, dilatancy and compaction, and evolving surface profiles under shear?

I extract continuum fields — including velocity, strain-rate, and the full stress tensor — via coarse-graining and systematic post-processing of particle-scale data.

## What I Do

I design and run high-resolution DEM simulations of sheared granular systems and translate particle-scale dynamics into continuum-scale insights.

My expertise includes:

- Shear-band formation and secondary flow analysis  
- Particle alignment and stress anisotropy quantification  
- Free-surface evolution under shear  
- Coarse-graining techniques for continuum field extraction  
- Automated simulation workflows and large-scale data analysis in Python/MATLAB  
- Pattern formation in reaction–diffusion PDE systems (Turing pattern formation)
