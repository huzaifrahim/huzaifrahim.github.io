### PhD Researcher — Computational Physics (DEM & HPC)
**Institute for Multiscale Simulation, FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg**, Erlangen, Germany  
**2022 – Present** *(thesis submitted)*

- Developed DEM models for granular shear flows, focusing on particle shape and friction effects.
- Built large-scale simulation workflows in **C++ and Python**, including automation and post-processing.
- Ran full simulation campaigns on **HPC clusters**, from design to execution.
- Developed scalable pipelines for processing and visualizing multi-terabyte simulation datasets.
- Performed sensitivity and stability analysis to validate model behaviour and identify key parameters.
