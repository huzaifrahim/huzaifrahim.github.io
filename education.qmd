## PhD

**PhD Researcher — Computational Physics (2022–Present; thesis submitted)**  
**Institute for Multiscale Simulation, FAU Erlangen–Nürnberg**, Erlangen, Germany  

**Dissertation:** *Multiscale analysis of shear-induced surface deformation in granular materials composed of non-spherical particles*  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Dr.-Ing. Thorsten Pöschel  

**Research focus:**
- Investigated shear-induced deformation and surface evolution in dense granular materials using DEM simulations.  
- Analyzed stress fields, localization, and volumetric response through coarse-graining and parameter studies.  
- Implemented and modified simulation code in C++ and Python; performed numerical integration of ODE/PDE systems and stability analysis.  
- Automated simulation and post-processing workflows using Bash and Python on Linux-based HPC systems.  
- Conducted statistical analysis, data fitting, and visualization of large simulation datasets.  
- Applied image processing methods (e.g., binarization and pixel-based density analysis) to quantify surface morphology.
