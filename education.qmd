## PhD

**PhD Researcher (Dr.-Ing. candidate, thesis submitted) — Computational Physics**  
**Institute for Multiscale Simulation, FAU Erlangen–Nürnberg**, Erlangen, Germany  

**Dissertation:** *Multiscale analysis of shear-induced surface deformation in granular materials composed of non-spherical particles*  
**Supervisor:** Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Dr.-Ing. Thorsten Pöschel  

**Research focus:**  
- Studied shear-induced deformation and surface evolution in dense granular materials using DEM.  
- Quantified stress fields, shear localization, and volumetric response via coarse-graining.  
- Implemented and modified simulation code in C++ and Python.  
- Automated simulation and post-processing workflows using Bash and Python on Linux-based HPC systems.  
- Performed statistical analysis, data fitting, and visualization of large simulation datasets.  
- Applied image processing (binarization, pixel-density analysis) to quantify surface morphology.
