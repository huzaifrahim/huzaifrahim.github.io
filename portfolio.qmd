Here are selected projects from my Master's and PhD work, focused on DEM simulations, granular flow, and pattern fomrmation in a reaction-diffusion system.

<!-- 1 -->
## Impact of friction and grain shape on the morphology of sheared granular media (PhD)

DEM study of how friction and particle shape control alignment, dilatancy, and surface morphology in a linear split-bottom shear cell.

- MercuryDPM simulations with spheres and elongated grains (AR = 1–5, µ = 0.01–0.8)
- Quantified shear-band packing density, stress ratio (τ/p), and alignment (θx, nematic order S)
- Linked alignment-driven compaction vs friction-driven dilatancy to surface depressions

## Alignment-induced depression and shear thinning in granular matter of nonspherical particles (PhD)

DEM study of shear-induced alignment, surface depression formation, and shear-thinning rheology of elongated grains in a linear split-bottom shear cell.

- MercuryDPM simulations with multisphere elongated particles (AR = 1–5)
- Stress analysis: normal stress differences and macroscopic friction µ(AR)
- Effective viscosity η(I) shows shear-thinning and pressure-dependent scaling

## Shear-induced pressure anisotropy in granular materials of nonspherical particles (PhD)

DEM study of shear-induced pressure localization in a linear split-bottom shear cell, comparing elongated particles to spheres over a wide friction range.

- MercuryDPM simulations: AR = 1 vs AR = 5, µ = 0.01–0.8
- Coarse-grained pressure and stress fields in the y–z plane
- Mechanism: alignment-driven packing density increase and normal stress anisotropy

## Dilatancy-Induced Heap Formation in Dense Cohesive Granular Media (PhD)

DEM study of wet granular shear flow showing how liquid-bridge cohesion amplifies dilatancy and generates heap formation above the shear band.

- MercuryDPM simulations with capillary bridge cohesion (γ = 0–0.160 N/m)
- Quantified heap evolution using surface area ratio A/A0
- Identified equivalent Bond number as the main control parameter; high shear rates suppress heap formation

## Pattern selection of three components Gray-Scott model (2019)

Analytical study of diffusion-driven instability and pattern selection in a three-component reaction–diffusion system.

- Derived Turing instability conditions using Jacobian and Routh–Hurwitz criteria
- Computed dispersion relations and bifurcation thresholds
- Derived amplitude equations via weakly nonlinear analysis to classify stripe vs hexagon regimes
